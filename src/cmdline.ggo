package		"vcf2multialign"
purpose		"Create multiply-aligned haplotype sequences from a variant call file and a reference sequence."
usage		"vcf2multialign --reference=filename.fa --variants=filename.vcf [...]"
description
"The sequences will be written into text files created in the current working directory. The files will be named “sample_id-chr_idx” as listed in the variant file. Dashes “-” will be output when needed to make the sequences aligned.

To output more sequences in one pass, please adjust the maximum number of open files per process with “ulimit -n” and increase the chunk size."
